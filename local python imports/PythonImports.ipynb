This particular complaint is one I've heard a lot from budding programmers and was also one of my own pain points as I was learning (and still is to some extent!). However, it actually follows a few simple rules and what you can (and can't) do can be puzzled out fairly easily if you know what you're doing.\n",

Most of these directories are not important (for you - Python still needs them!), but there are two key locations which you should know about: the site-packages, and the one where Python is executed.\n",
